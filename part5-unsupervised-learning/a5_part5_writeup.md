# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
Someonen with a high annual income and a high spending score would be called "luxurious". Someone with a high/meduim annual income and a low spending score would be "saver". Someone with low spending and low income might be in a "realistic" group because they are only spending what they earn. Low income people with high spending habits and low income could be called the "dreamers" because they are spending way out of their comfort zone. 

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
This person would be classified as a saver because they have a decent amount of money but are careful to save it in order to build wealth. 

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group? I think someone could target the luxurious group of spenders by marketing something as high end, good quality, and expensicve. Usually these brand ambassadors are celeberties or people that exude wealth, and the campaings are more subtle.
