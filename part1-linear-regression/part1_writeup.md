# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
 0.6257932855322312 shows that this is the change in blood pressure relative to age. 

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
139.7 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model? I think that this model is an accurate way to find a patients blood pressure because the data is linear, therefore a linear equation can be used to predict blood pressure.
