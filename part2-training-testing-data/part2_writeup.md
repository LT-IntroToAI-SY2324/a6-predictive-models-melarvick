# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson? The model in this lesson had more data, so it is easier to find patterns and a more accurate line of best fit. 


2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model? The r squared value is .73, meaning that it is a very accurate model, more so than the previous model. 


3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure. I believe this model is more accurate than the one before, but obviously not 100% accurate because every age group has certain outliers and factors that can affect blood pressure.
