# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data? The r squared value for this model is .86, which indicates a strong correlation. 

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not? This means that the model is generally pretty accurate. 

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles? $14765.95 for the 10 year old car and 14063 for the 20 year old car 

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening? The car might not be worth anything, and so the value decreases even more the more the owner drives it.
